### Maps in Go ###

Maps in Go are a powerful data structure for storing key-value pairs. They're unordered collections, meaning the order of elements is not guaranteed.

### Key Points to Remember ###

    Map keys must be comparable.
    Map values can be of any type.
    Maps are unordered.
    Use the len function to get the number of key-value pairs in a map.
